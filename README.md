## Objectives

The overarching objective is simply to get some experience playing with RUN and create and share ways of integrating RUN with some of my own tools. 

1. Create a Berry class for loading [Univrse](https://univrse.network/) transactions into jigs
2. Create sidekick code for decoding Univrse envelopes in the RUN context
3. Create a jig class for creating NFTs from Univrse envelopes
4. Experiment with using [paypresto](https://www.paypresto.co) as a RUN purse and if needed create a mega simply library that makes it as easy as possible for others
5. Build a mega simple POC app for minting and sending **Shfty Nfts**
